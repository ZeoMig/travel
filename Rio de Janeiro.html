        The Statue of Christ the Redeemer is a famous sculpture of Jesus with outstretched arms, which is installed on top of Mount Corcovado in the Brazilian capital Rio de Janeiro. It is considered a symbol of the city and the whole country, and is also included in the list of modern seven wonders of the world. The mountain rises 800 meters above Rio, so from the foot of the statue there is a stunning view of the capital and its individual attractions, including Sugarloaf Peak, the large Guanabara Bay and the long bridge over it, the famous Maracana Stadium, Ipanema and Copacabana beaches.

        The total height of the sculpture is 38 meters, taking into account the eightâ€“meter pedestal, and the span of the outstretched arms is 28 m. The statue of Christ the Redeemer weighs more than 1,000 tons, but despite this, it looks elegant from a distance. Almost 2 million tourists visit the monument every year.
