The Colosseum is one of the most recognizable architectural monuments both in Italy and around the world. For almost two thousand years, the majestic amphitheater, located in the very center of Rome, has been gathering millions of visitors who want to see this iconic building with their own eyes.

The name Colosseum comes from the Latin word colosseus, which means "huge". This seemed to be the construction of the Romans at the dawn of our era, when the height of most buildings did not exceed 10 meters. Modern tourists estimate the size of the amphitheater differently, as skyscrapers have changed our sense of scale. But it is important to understand that the peculiarity of the Colosseum is not in the height of its walls, but in the cultural and historical contribution that it has made to civilization.
